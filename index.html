    <h3 style="font-family: 'Helvetica'; font-weight: 200;">There are many children and teens who go through many 
        problems like stress, depression, anxiety, and many more. 
        Being afraid to express themselves to be evaluated by someone, like friends, or laughed at 
        or scolded by parents and elders. I would love to create an application for this serious issue that 
        basically allows people to chat with experts or express themselves to some unknown person, which could 
        help resolve their issue. Expressing themselves to an unknown person would be different for them; they 
        didn't care if they were judged or laughed at. The experts can resolve their problem by providing the 
        correct suggestions and preventing them from doing something wrong.
        This app can have a profile of particular user. App will ask during login or sign in page whether 
        you are teens for helper. If user is teen there will be asking of age and further important details. 
        If helper than there will much more asking for details to make sure the user are safe to communicate.
