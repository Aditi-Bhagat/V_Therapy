        <h2>Hello There!</h2>
        <h2 style="font-family:'Trebuchet MS'">My name is Aditi Bhagat.</h2>

        <p>I really had very lovely moments with WhiteHat Jr. and I am very faithful to them for giving this wonderful 
            opportunity. They showed me some different talent I had hidden, because of them and My teachers I was able 
            to utilize it. I really don't have words for their kindness. I still remember that first demo class I had, 
            I was amazing class. I am grateful to them for everything they have done to me. Regarding teachers, I had 
            two really AMAZING teachers. They both were wonderful and energetic. They made topics so understandable. They 
            were like my dream teacher. And for classes and topic was were amazing. For my point of view, every class was 
            interesting and I was always very joyful to attend the class. Every project was astonishing. And also every 
            Technical Team who help for my camera or microphone and etc..., I very grateful to them too. Honestly, I wish 
            I can spend more time with this Amazing Team. Lastly, I am very Thankful To everyone of WhiteHat Jr. Team.</p>
